# Todo

- Add more logic to the buttons so they manage state better
  - Start button should look disabled while time is running.
  - Stop button should look disabled while timer is stopped.
  - Reset button should look disabled while time is already reset.
- Change toggle button to an actual toggle element so current state is
  more clear.
- Make a change to the toggle also trigger a reset
- Can I make the stop button a pause button instead? Must be able to resume
  at the same point.
  - If I can do this, change the text of the start button to "Resume" in a pause.

- Style the Navbar so it matches the rest of the app.
- Integrate sounds to indicate transitions between work and breaks
- Make sure that the layout is mobile-friendly (use to review css flexbox).
- Add a backend so that users can sign-in and log their study time with the timer.
  - Add live visualizations of their progress.
